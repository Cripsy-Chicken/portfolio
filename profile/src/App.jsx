The platform was powered by a Node/Express.js API, serving data from a MongoDB Atlas database, with secure environment variable management for deployment. I deployed the application to AWS Lightsail, ensuring continuous uptime with Apache as a reverse proxy, and adhered to best practices for code organization and thorough documentation."
